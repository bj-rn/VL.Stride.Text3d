# VL.Stride.Text3d

Set of nodes to create and render (extruded) 3d text in VL.Stride.

The nodes make use of [Extruder.cs](https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv/blob/master/Nodes/VVVV.DX11.Nodes.Text3d/Extruder.cs), [ExtrudingSink.cs](https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv/blob/master/Nodes/VVVV.DX11.Nodes.Text3d/ExtrudingSink.cs) and [OutlineRenderer.cs](https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv/blob/master/Nodes/VVVV.DX11.Nodes.Text3d/OutlineRenderer.cs) that come with [dx11-vvvv](https://github.com/mrvux/dx11-vvvv) by 
[Julien Vulliet aka mrvux](https://github.com/mrvux). I made only some minor changes. His code is licensed under BSD 3, refer to [DX11-vvvv-License.md](https://github.com/bj-rn/VL.Stride.Text3d/blob/master/DX11-vvvv-License.md) for details.

The library itself is released under [MIT license](https://github.com/bj-rn/VL.Stride.Text3d/blob/master/LICENSE).
